# Inventory POS Project

## Current Status

Parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 are complete and tested (Part 4 was verified with a
real compiler and a real JavaFX runtime - see Part 4 Testing Notes below).

- Java 21
- Maven
- JavaFX
- Login screen lets the user pick a Role (ADMIN / CASHIER) from a dropdown
  and stores it in Session. This is NOT a full username/password
  authentication system yet - that would require a User model/service,
  which has not been requested.
- Session (com.inventory.util) holds the currently selected Role for the
  whole running application.
- Dashboard has a working "Inventory" button (disabled for CASHIER) and
  "Logout" button.
- Product model with Category enum implemented
- Product data persists to data/products.txt (auto-created with sample data)
- ProductFileRepository handles all product File I/O
- ProductService handles product validation, search, and filtering
- InventoryService handles stock in/out and low-stock detection
- Custom exceptions: ProductNotFoundException, DuplicateProductException,
  InsufficientStockException, InvalidProductException
- Inventory screen (inventory.fxml + InventoryController): TableView of all
  products with a computed Status column (OK / LOW STOCK), Add/Edit/Delete,
  Stock In/Stock Out, search box, category filter, and a Low Stock toggle -
  all working together. ADMIN-only actions are disabled for CASHIER both at
  the Dashboard (nav button hidden/disabled) and again inside the Inventory
  screen itself (defense in depth).
- CartItem model (com.inventory.model): one line of a cart - a Product plus
  a quantity, with getSubtotal() = price x quantity.
- Cart model (com.inventory.model): owns a List<CartItem> and is the only
  class allowed to add/remove/update those items. Provides addItem,
  removeItem, updateQuantity, clear, getItems (returns a defensive copy),
  getSubtotal, isEmpty. Enforces that a product's total cart quantity never
  exceeds its current stock (InsufficientStockException) and rejects
  invalid input like a null product or a zero/negative quantity
  (InvalidCartOperationException, a new exception class alongside the
  existing four).
- POS screen (pos.fxml + POSController): search/select a product from a
  TableView (ID, Product, Category, Price, Stock), enter a quantity, and
  Add to Cart. A second TableView shows the current cart (Product,
  Quantity, Price, Subtotal) with Update Quantity / Remove Item / Clear
  Cart actions and a running Subtotal label. POSController never touches
  files or cart math directly - it calls ProductService for product lookup
  and Cart for everything cart-related.
- Dashboard now has a "Point of Sale" button, usable by BOTH Admin and
  Cashier (unlike the Inventory button, it is never disabled).
- Adding a product to the cart does NOT change the product's saved stock
  quantity yet - stock is only meant to be deducted at checkout, which is
  a later phase. The cart only checks stock, it never modifies it.

## Current Phase

Part 4 completed: Cart + Point of Sale (POS) product-selection screen.

Explicitly NOT built yet (by design, per the Part 4 request): payment,
discounts, tax, checkout, receipts, and sales transaction history. Those
are the next phase. A real User/authentication system can also be added
at some point if desired, replacing the simple Session/Role dropdown.

## Important Rules

- Java 21
- Maven
- JavaFX
- Standard Java File I/O
- No database
- No Spring
- No Hibernate
- No external backend
- Keep the architecture beginner-friendly
- Use OOP concepts clearly
- Preserve existing working code
- Do not recreate existing classes unnecessarily
- Do not change the Maven/JavaFX configuration unless necessary

## Part 3 Testing Notes

The sandbox used to build this phase does not have a JDK compiler
(`javac`) or Maven installed, and has no network access to download
JavaFX. Every new/changed file was therefore verified by hand instead of
with a live `mvn compile`:
- Every `fx:id` and `onAction="#method"` in login.fxml, dashboard.fxml,
  and inventory.fxml was cross-checked against a matching `@FXML` field
  or method in the matching controller.
- Every model/service/repository method called from a controller was
  checked against its real method signature.
- Imports were checked against every class/type actually used.

## Part 4 Testing Notes

Unlike Part 3, this sandbox was able to install a real JDK (`javac`) and
JavaFX libraries from Ubuntu's package repositories, so Part 4 was tested
with actual tools instead of by hand-review alone:
- `javac` compiled every source file in the project (Parts 1-4 together)
  against real JavaFX jars with zero errors.
- A standalone test (not part of the app) exercised `Cart` directly and
  covered every case from the Part 4 test list: empty cart, add, add the
  same product twice (quantities combine), change quantity, remove item,
  clear cart, insufficient stock on both add and update, invalid
  quantities, a missing product, and subtotal math. All 21 checks passed.
- A second standalone test loaded `pos.fxml` for real (via `FXMLLoader`,
  under a virtual display) and drove the actual controls - typing in the
  search box, selecting table rows, clicking the real "Add to Cart" /
  "Update Quantity" / "Remove Item" buttons - the same way a person
  clicking through the app would. All 15 checks passed.
- A third test ran the real `Main` class end-to-end and navigated
  Login -> Dashboard -> POS with no exceptions, confirming Part 4 did not
  break Parts 1-3.
- One real bug was caught and fixed this way: the first draft of
  pos.fxml had `<!-- ----- ... ----- -->` style comments, and XML does
  not allow `--` inside a comment. This crashed FXML loading until the
  comments were changed to `<!-- ===== ... ===== -->` (matching the style
  already used in inventory.fxml).
- These standalone tests are throwaway sandbox tools, not part of the
  project - they live outside `src/`, so nothing was added to the actual
  Maven project by this verification step.

Please still run `mvn clean javafx:run` in IntelliJ once, since that is
the real target environment (JavaFX 21 via Maven) and the one place a
learner will actually see the app run, and report back anything odd.

## Development Rule

Before implementing each phase:

1. Inspect the entire existing project.
2. Understand existing classes and relationships.
3. Identify files that need modification.
4. Identify new files that need to be created.
5. Explain the implementation plan.
6. Implement only the requested phase.
7. Compile the project.
8. Fix compilation errors.
9. Test the existing functionality.
10. Update this PROJECT.md.
